<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# üìñ Bookstore<a name="about-project"></a>


 The Bookstore is a web application that allows users to manage a collection of books. It is a simplified version of the "Awesome Books" website, providing basic functionality to display, add, and remove books.

## üõ† Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>
This calculator app is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** The programming language used to develop the calculator logic.
- **HTML:** The markup language used for structuring the calculator's UI.
- **CSS:** The styling language used for customizing the appearance of the calculator.
- **Babel:** A JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) code into backward-compatible versions for browser support.
- **Webpack:** A module bundler that packages the JavaScript and CSS files for deployment.
- **ESLint:** A JavaScript linter used for static code analysis to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **Git:** A version control system for tracking changes in the codebase and facilitating collaboration.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for hosting the project's Git repository and enabling code sharing and collaboration.
- **npm:** The package manager for installing and managing project dependencies.
- **VS Code:** A popular code editor with excellent support for JavaScript and React development.

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>


-Display a List of Books: The application provides a visually appealing interface to view a list of books. Each book is represented by its title and author.

-Add a Book: Users can add new books to the collection by providing the book's title and author. The application ensures that both fields are filled before allowing the addition of a book.

-Remove a Selected Book: Users can easily remove a selected book from the collection with the click of a button. This functionality allows for easy book management and organization.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üíª Installation and setup <a name="getting-started"></a>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## üî≠ Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- [ ] **Technologies - For my project, I utilized React with a focus on the ES6 syntax for enhanced functionality. Additionally, I utilized  webpacks**
- [ ] **Responsive Design: As more and more users are accessing the web on mobile devices, it's important to ensure that your website looks and works well on all screen sizes. This feature would allow the website to adapt to the screen size of the device it's being viewed on.**
- [ ] **Accessibility: This feature would make the website easy to navigate and use for users with disabilities. This can include things like providing alternative text for images, using semantic HTML tags, and ensuring that the website's contrast ratio is high enough to be easily read by users with low vision.**
- [ ] **CSS preprocessors: CSS preprocessors such as Sass or Less will allow you to use variables, nested selectors, mixins and many other features that can make your CSS code more maintainable and organized. This can help you to write cleaner and more modular CSS code, making it easier to update and maintain.**
